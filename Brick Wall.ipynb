    "The function leastBricks takes a list of lists wall as input, where each inner list represents a row of bricks in a wall. The function returns an integer which represents the minimum number of bricks that need to be cut in order to make the wall such that no vertical line crosses through the wall.\n",

    "The algorithm works by iterating over each row in the wall and keeping track of the gaps between bricks. The hash table myhash is used to store the number of times a particular gap index is encountered while iterating through the rows of the wall. If a gap index is encountered more than once, it means that a vertical line can be drawn through that gap, and hence a brick needs to be cut at that index.\n",
